  <h1>MyGann+ Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>Stored Data</h3>
  <p>
    All MyGann+ data (options, favorites, etc.) is stored in your computer's browser.
    If you are signed into your Google account in Google Chrome, that data is also synced with your Google account.
    All data that MyGann+ stores is not accessible by anyone except for yourself.
    MyGann+ does not store any information about your grades, classes, messages, or any other confidential data.
  </p>
  <h3>Bug Reports</h3>
  <p>
    If you send a bug report through MyGann+, it will upload diagnostics data about MyGann+ to <a
      href="http://myjson.com">myjson.com</a>.
    It only uploads technical data about MyGann+ itself, including the currently installed extension version and which MyGann+ features are currently running, 
    and does not send any data that you entered.
    If you chose to attach an image, that image will be uploaded to Imgur in an anonymous, unlisted album.
